            <p style="color:000000;font-family:georgia;margin-left:100px;margin-right:100px">I work remotely as a computer programmer for Guerilla Games. My salary is about $145,000 per year. I live with my wife and 15 year old kid in a suburban house just outside of San Francisco. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading or taking my kid out camping. A huge bonus of San Francisco is the frequent concerts that I often go to. On the side, I'm also working on an indie game as a passion project. One day I hope to be able to leave my job in order to work full-time on game development though at the moment it is very unfeasible. I upgraded my car quite a few times over the years, and now I drive a Toyota hybrid which cost me about $40,000. It's a pretty nice car. Our house cost about [insert cost] which we're still paying off to this day.</p>
